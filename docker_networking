networking between host and container is done by the network bridge

we can create mutiple virtual networks in dcoker

we can find the container ip address using docker container inspect

or in detial by using

docker container inspect '{.NetworkSettings.IpAddress}' container name/id

if we specify 

-net=host at time of creation it will take hostnetwork as its main network

docker network drivers is another plugin for managing the docker
