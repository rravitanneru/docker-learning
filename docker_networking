networking between host and container is done by the network bridge

we can create mutiple virtual networks in dcoker

we can find the container ip address using docker container inspect

or in detial by using

docker container inspect '{.NetworkSettings.IpAddress}' container name/id

if we specify 

-net=host at time of creation it will take hostnetwork as its main network

docker network drivers is another plugin for managing the docker

we can list mutiple docker-networks with 

docker network ls ------------command
docker network inspect network name/id to find attached containers

by default docker0 or bridge is a bridged interface for the default docker network

to create a own a docker virtual network

docker network create network_name

to attach a container to virtual network

docker network connect virtual_network_name    container_name/id

docker container inspect container name/id to find the container's default netowrk

create a new docker container with our own virtual network

docker container run -d --network=host --name webhost2 nginx ----this command will bind to hostnetwork
