1.Docker container life is very short but the infrastrue is immutable which means re-deploy a exsiting image without no change
2.Data inside docker container is pershied when the container stops
3.This creates a problem when running  a database inside the docker container
4.docker has two solutios for this
5. 1.volumes   2.Bind mounts

----------------------------------
volumes

1.volumes are an external storage(from docker host)
2.Volumes a storage path from the docker host mounted inside the docker when it starts
3.Volumes are deleted when we remove the container
4.volumes are still avaliable evena after the docker container deletion
5.We have to manually delete the voumes
6. prune is the command in the docker which removed unused
7.docker volume prune removes the unsed voulmes
