1.docker engine has bultin dns server
2.docker default bridge network doesn't has the dns option by default
3.we can use dns in default network bridge using '--link' option
4.simple by creating another virtual nework and linking container to that networks gives you dns feature
example

docker container run -d -p 80:80 --network=my_network --name=webhost1 nginx
docker container run -d -p 80:80 --network=my_network --name=webhost2 nginx

now ping inside wenhost1'or'wenhost1 to wenhost2'or'wenhost1

dns succesfully resoves
